In computer science and information theory, a Huffman code is a particular type of optimal prefix code 
that is commonly used for lossless data compression.
The process of finding or using such a code proceeds by means of Huffman coding, an algorithm developed by David A.
Huffman while he was a Sc.D. student at MIT, and published in the 1952 paper "A Method for the Construction of Minimum-Redundancy Codes".
